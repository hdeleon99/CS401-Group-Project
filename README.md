The Distributed File System (DFS)
=
The DFS is meant to illustrate an understanding of Java, multi-threaded systems, client/server models, server sockets, back-end and front-end development, and requirements gathering. As a team of three, we met weekly to dicuss project development progress and ensure our deadlines could be met. The system replicates the functionality of a standard distributed file management software, in which multiple clients can upload files to a server and access files with the appropriate privilges.

# Features 
* Upload files that can be accessed by any user of the system
* Upload files that can only be accessed by users with supervisor privilges
* Access uploaded files based on privilege status 
* Remove files as supervisor
* Java SWING GUI
